# dotfiles

This is a repo to maintain and sync my dotfiles and tools. Is is inspired by many great examples at [http://dotfiles.github.io](http://dotfiles.github.io). This repo is relatively customised to my use.

## Install

Run `./dotfiles.sh bootstrap` to load all dotfiles into your home directory.

## Backup

To backup your current dotfiles, run `./dotfiles.sh backup`.
