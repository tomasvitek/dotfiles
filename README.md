# dotfiles

This is a repo to maintain and sync my dotfiles and tools. Is is inspired by many great examples at [http://dotfiles.github.io](http://dotfiles.github.io). This repo is relatively customised to my use.

## Install

Run the `bootstrap.sh` script to copy all your dotfiles to your home folder.

## Update

To keep up to date with your current configuration files, run the `update.sh` script to copy all your dotfiles from your home folder and commit the changes.
